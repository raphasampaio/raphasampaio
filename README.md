# Raphael Sampaio

Raphael Sampaio holds a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the Department of Computer Science at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), granted in 2015. His studies included an academic exchange at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. From 2012 to 2016, he worked at Tecgraf PUC-Rio, where he was part of a collaborative effort with COPPE/UFRJ and CENPES/PETROBRAS. During this time, he integrated a team that developed a finite-element-based structural tool to analyze flexible and rigid risers in offshore engineering. He then obtained an MSc in Computer Science from PUC-Rio in 2018, specializing in Optimization and Machine Learning. Since 2016, he integrated the PSR team in Brazil. His responsibilities involve using his software development, optimization, and machine learning expertise to create and maintain models and products using C++, Dart/Flutter, Julia, and Lua. He is committed to code quality, efficiency, and test-driven development practices to ensure the delivery of robust and reliable software.
